**Evil Martians** is a product development consultancy that works with [startups and established businesses](https://evilmartians.com/clients), 
builds [developer tools](https://evilmartians.com/oss), and creates [open source-based products](https://evilmartians.com/products).

Clients trust us to be the core technical team behind their startups, delivering all elements of successful product work: user interface design backed by analytics, agile software development, infrastructure administration, and service reliability. We pay extra attention to mentoring, making sure that the practices we bring in are adopted by the internal team before our collaboration is over.

**Our Open Source**

Open source is a defining part of Martian culture. We’ve created dozens of libraries and utilities for developers in diverse programming language communities, as well as tools and plugins for UI designers.

**Some of our key products:**

|   | Product |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [![PostCSS](postcss.svg)](https://github.com/postcss) | Designed to make large CSS codebases more maintainable and bring more exciting ideas into the world of CSS tooling, [**PostCSS**](https://github.com/postcss) has become one of Evil Martians’ most popular products. Today it is used by industry leaders like Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, Bootstrap, GitHub, Wordpress, Taobao, Twitter, and many other large businesses and startups. |
| [![imgproxy](imgproxy.svg)](https://github.com/imgproxy) | [**imgproxy**](https://github.com/imgproxy) is a blazing fast and secure image processing tool. Built by developers for developers, imgproxy resizes and processes images on the fly and doesn’t consume disk space. It reduces your costs and removes the costly requirement that all saved images conform to specific formats. |
| [![AnyCable](anycable.svg)](https://github.com/anycable) | [**AnyCable**](https://github.com/anycable) is a way to build reliable real-time features natively on Ruby on Rails without using 3rd-party services. Save up to 10x on infrastructure compared to built-in ActionCable without sacrificing Rails productivity by switching to third-party services: a fast Golang server handles the load, a gRPC-driven Rails application deals with business-logic. The Pro version offers even more benefits: an additional 40% reduced memory footprint, DX improvements, and priority support. |
| [![Logux](logux.svg)](https://github.com/logux) | [**Logux**](https://github.com/logux) is a new way to connect clients (web and mobile apps) and servers. Instead of sending HTTP requests (AJAX/REST), it synchronizes the operations log between client, server, and other clients through WebSockets. Building on top of CRDT (conflict-free replicated data type) ideas, it features live updates, an optimistic UI, and is offline-first by design. |
